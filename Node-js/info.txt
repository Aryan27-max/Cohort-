MAJOR -  Major version changes indicate significant updates or breaking changes. 
MINOR -  Minor version changes signify the addition of new features or improvements in a backward-compatible manner.
PATCH - Patch version changes include backward-compatible bug fixes or minor improvements that address issues without adding new features or causing breaking changes.
