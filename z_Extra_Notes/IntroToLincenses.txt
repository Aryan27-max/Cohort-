🔐 What is a Software License (in simple words)?

A license tells others:

✅ What they are allowed to do with your code

❌ What they cannot do

⚠️ Who is responsible if something breaks

Without a license → no one legally has permission to use your code.

🧠 Big Picture: Types of Licenses

Software licenses usually fall into 3 major categories:

Category	        Freedom Level       	Main Idea
Permissive	        🔓 Very Open	    “Do almost anything, just give credit”
Copyleft	        ⚖️ Conditional	    “You can use it, but keep it open”
Proprietary	        🔒 Closed	        “You can’t use this freely”

1️⃣ Permissive Licenses (Most popular for devs)

These are developer-friendly and startup-friendly.

✅ MIT License (what you chose)

Meaning:

✔ Use

✔ Modify

✔ Sell

✔ Use in closed-source projects

❗ Just keep the copyright notice

Best for:

Portfolios

Libraries

Hackathons

SaaS products

Startups

👉 Why MIT is loved:

“I don’t care what you do with my code, just don’t sue me.”

✅ Apache 2.0

Same as MIT + extra protection

Adds:

✔ Explicit patent protection

✔ Contribution safety

Best for:

Big projects

Enterprise software

Open-source frameworks

⚠ Slightly more legal text than MIT.

✅ BSD (2-clause / 3-clause)

Very similar to MIT.

Difference:

BSD-3 has a clause preventing others from using your name for promotion.

Used mostly in academia / system software.

2️⃣ Copyleft Licenses (Freedom with conditions)

These licenses force openness.

⚖️ GPL (General Public License)

Rule:

If you use GPL code → your entire project must also be GPL.

✔ Open
❌ Cannot be closed-source

Best for:

Ideological open-source

Community-driven tools

Bad for:

Startups

Commercial SaaS

⚖️ LGPL

A softer GPL.

✔ Can be used in closed-source apps
✔ Changes to the library must stay open

Common for shared libraries.

3️⃣ Proprietary / Closed Licenses

❌ No modification

❌ No redistribution

❌ No resale

Used by:

Windows

Adobe

Paid software

👉 You don’t need this unless you’re selling binaries under strict terms.
